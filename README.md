# INFOF422 - Statistical Foundations of Machine Learning

This page contains the material for the hands-on classes of ULB [INFO-F-422](https://uv.ulb.ac.be/course/view.php?id=76801).

## Getting ready with R notebooks

The use of the notebooks requires to install:

* **R**: see installation instructions [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).
* **Python 3.7**: see installation instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/-). **N.B.** Check the box asking for adding Python to PATH in the installer (if required).
* **Jupyter Notebook**, see installation instructions [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html).  
* **IRkernel**, see installation instructions [here](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel). **N.B**: You may need to restart R after Jupyter installation in order to be able to install IRkernel. 

Once installed, clone this repository and start jupyter notebook:

```
git clone https://github.com/jdestefani/StatisticalFoundationsML_INFOF422.git
cd StatisticalFoundationsML_INFOF422
jupyter notebook
```
